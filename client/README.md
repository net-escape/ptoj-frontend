> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> The development of Putong OJ is closely tailored to the practical needs of the ACM Lab at CJLU, incorporating numerous customized features. 
> 
> If you wish to deploy your own instance, we recommend forking the repository and modifying the code according to your requirements. Currently, Putong OJ does not support configuration options for these customized features.

> [!CAUTION]  
>   
> The current branch may contain untested changes after dependency upgrades. For production use, we strongly recommend using the last stable version from commit [`ce13bf1`](https://github.com/net-escape/ptoj-frontend/commit/ce13bf1988bb4923947b9b72a0b8a371d3110469).
